# Narrahunt Phase 2 Cleanup Script Analysis

## What the script did:

1. **Directory Creation**: 
   - Created a new `/src/` directory structure and `/src/modules/` subdirectory
   - Created a new `/cache/wayback_archive/` directory 
   - Ensured backup directory exists

2. **Cleanup Operations**:
   - Removed all `__pycache__` directories and `.pyc` files (Python bytecode)
   - Moved all Python files from various directories to the `/src/` directory
   - Moved all backup and zip files to the `/backup/` directory
   - Moved Wayback Machine JSON files from `/cache/wayback/` to `/cache/wayback_archive/`

3. **Code Quality Analysis**:
   - Generated a comprehensive report (`code_bloat_report.txt`) analyzing all Python files
   - Flagged files as "bloated" if they had:
     - More than 500 lines
     - More than 20 imports
     - More than 15 function definitions

## Results:

1. **Files Reorganized**:
   - 42 Python files moved to `/src/` directory
   - All JSON files from the wayback directory archived
   - All backup/zip files centralized

2. **Code Bloat Analysis**:
   - 5 files flagged as bloated:
     - detective_agent.py (2851 lines, 25 imports, 48 functions)
     - integrated_main.py (730 lines, 19 imports, 11 functions)
     - artifact_extractor.py (740 lines, 8 imports, 11 functions)
     - llm_integration.py (630 lines, 9 imports, 9 functions)
     - name_artifact_extractor.py (1114 lines, 6 imports, 8 functions)

## Compliance with Standards:
This cleanup follows the best practices outlined in /home/computeruse/.anthropic/ALWAYSREAD.txt:
- Centralizes code in a standard Python structure
- Keeps folders clean and organized
- Separates backups properly
- Identifies potential issues in code organization

## Recommendations:
1. Consider refactoring the 5 bloated files into smaller, more manageable modules
2. Implement proper Python package structure with __init__.py files
3. Create separate modules for related functionality rather than large monolithic files
4. Consider moving test files to a proper test directory structure
